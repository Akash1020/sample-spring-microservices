In this project I'm demonstrating you the most interesting features of [Spring Cloud Project](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud) for building microservice-based architecture. Most of examples are based on **Spring Boot 1.5**.

## Getting Started 
Currently you may find here some examples of microservices implementation using different projects from Spring Cloud. All the examples are divided into the branches and described in a separated articles on my blog. Here's a full list of available examples:
1. Introduction to Spring Cloud components like discovery with **Eureka**, load balancing with **Ribbon**, REST client **Feign**, API gataway with **Zuul**. The example is available in the branch [master](https://github.com/piomin/sample-spring-microservices/tree/master). A detailed description can be found here: [Part 1: Creating microservice using Spring Cloud, Eureka and Zuul](https://piotrminkowski.wordpress.com/2017/02/05/part-1-creating-microservice-using-spring-cloud-eureka-and-zuul/)
2. Introduction to Spring Cloud components used for microservices monitoring like **Spring Cloud Sleuth** and **Zipkin**. Integration with **Logstash** for sending logs to ELK. The example is available in the branch [master](https://github.com/piomin/sample-spring-microservices/tree/master). A detailed description can be found here: [Part 2: Creating microservices â€“ monitoring with Spring Cloud Sleuth, ELK and Zipkin](https://piotrminkowski.wordpress.com/2017/04/05/part-2-creating-microservices-monitoring-with-spring-cloud-sleuth-elk-and-zipkin/)
3. Introduction to load balancing with **Ribbon** and **Feign** declarative HTTP client, circuit braker and fallback with **Hystrix**. The example is available in the branch [hystrix](https://github.com/piomin/sample-spring-microservices/tree/hystrix). A detailed description can be found here: [Part 3: Creating Microservices: Circuit Breaker, Fallback and Load Balancing with Spring Cloud](https://piotrminkowski.wordpress.com/2017/05/15/part-3-creating-microservices-circuit-breaker-fallback-and-load-balancing-with-spring-cloud/)
4. Using tool **Spring Boot Admin** for managing and monitoring microservices-based system. The example is available in the branch [admin](https://github.com/piomin/sample-spring-microservices/tree/admin).
